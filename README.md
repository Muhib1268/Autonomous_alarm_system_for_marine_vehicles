# Autonomous_alarm_system_for_marine_vehicles
 This project deals with the real time tracking of the loading condition and movement of Center of Gravity (CG). To find out the CG in real time we investigated the possibility of mounting the load cells at important locations where the load tends to shift more. And after receiving the data from load cells placed in those locations, an estimate of total load and position of CG is suggested. If the total load exceeds the permissible limit, the alarm warms the vessel masters. And if the position of CG moves upward beyond metacenter another alarm will go off.
